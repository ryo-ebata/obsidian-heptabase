Heptabase-like heading explorer for Obsidian Canvas — search, browse, and drag headings onto Canvas as new notes.

## What is Heptabase?

[Heptabase](https://heptabase.com/) is a visual knowledge management tool that lets you break down notes into cards and arrange them on whiteboards. This plugin brings a similar workflow to Obsidian by letting you extract heading sections from your vault and place them onto Canvas as individual notes.

## Features

- **Sidebar heading explorer** — Browse all notes and their heading hierarchy in a right sidebar
- **Debounced search** — Quickly filter notes by title with real-time search
- **Library filters** — Filter by tag and folder, then sort by recency or title without rereading the Vault
- **Drag & drop to Canvas** — Drag any heading onto an open Canvas to create a new note
- **Smart content extraction** — Automatically extracts the full section content, including nested headings
- **Auto file creation** — Creates new files with sanitized names and handles filename collisions
- **Configurable node size** — Set default width and height for new Canvas nodes
- **Configurable output** — Choose an output folder and file name prefix for extracted notes
- **Backlink option** — Optionally leave a backlink in the original note after extraction
- **Extraction provenance** — Records the source note, heading, Canvas, and extraction time on new concept cards
- **Card context panel** — Shows source, backlinks, and every Canvas containing the current card
- **Canvas-to-article navigation** — Select a file node on Canvas to open it in the sidebar editor
- **Canvas search and focus** — Find cards, text, groups, and links on the current Canvas and zoom to them
- **Canvas selection tools** — Align, distribute, connect, or group selected cards from one toolbar, with synchronized Undo/Redo
- **Fast card capture** — Create a non-overlapping card, then name it immediately in a focused title editor
- **Keyboard accessible** — Full keyboard navigation support

## Installation

### Manual

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies and build:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   ```
3. Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` (if present) to your vault's plugin directory:
   ```
   <vault>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-heptabase/
   ```
4. Restart Obsidian and enable the plugin in Settings > Community Plugins

## Usage

1. Open a Canvas in Obsidian
2. Click the **list-tree** icon in the ribbon (left sidebar) to open the Heading Explorer
3. Browse or search for notes in the explorer panel
4. Expand a note to see its heading hierarchy
5. Drag a heading onto the Canvas — a new note is created with the extracted section content

Select multiple Canvas nodes and open Obsidian's command palette to align or distribute them. Alignment
requires two nodes; equal distribution requires three or more.

Run **Create new card** to place a selected card in the center of the visible Canvas. Cmd/Ctrl +
double-click an empty Canvas area to create one at that point. The new card opens with its title
selected, so typing replaces `Untitled` immediately.

## Settings

| Setting                | Description                                                                          | Default   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Extracted files folder | Folder to save extracted heading files. Leave empty to use the source file's folder. | _(empty)_ |
| Default node width     | Width for new Canvas nodes (200–800)                                                 | 400       |
| Default node height    | Height for new Canvas nodes (100–600)                                                | 300       |
| File name prefix       | Prefix for extracted file names                                                      | _(empty)_ |
| Leave backlink         | Leave a backlink in the original note after extracting                               | Off       |

## Development

UI changes must follow the [UX principles](docs/UX_PRINCIPLES.md). Smoothness and visual quality are
release criteria for this plugin.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Commands

```bash
pnpm dev        # Build in watch mode
pnpm build      # Production build
pnpm test       # Run tests
pnpm lint       # Lint with oxlint
pnpm format     # Auto-format with oxfmt
```

### Device testing in Obsidian

Build the plugin, create a reproducible UX audit vault, and open it in Obsidian:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm setup:device
pnpm open:device
```

The generated `.dev/ux-audit-vault` enables `obsidian-heptabase`, opens `UX監査Canvas.canvas`, and restores the Heading Explorer in a 380px right sidebar. Its notes cover folders, hierarchical tags, Japanese text, long titles, dense Canvas content, and empty/search/filter states. Use `UX監査チェックリスト.md` for the light/dark, narrow-width, keyboard, and continuous-operation audit. For iterative development, keep the vault open and run `pnpm dev`.

Obsidian requires one manual registration on first use: choose **Open folder as vault**, select `.dev/ux-audit-vault`, trust the local vault, and enable **Heptabase-like Heading Explorer**. After that, `pnpm open:device` opens it directly.
